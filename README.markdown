Bootstrap a Perl installation
=============================

The `bootstrap.sh` script will setup a Perl environment on your local home,
and proceed to install a set of useful modules.

The list of modules that will be installed is listed in the
[`dist.ini`](http://github.com/melo/My-Perl-bootstrap/blob/master/Task-Bootstrap/dist.ini) file.
